// Rewrite the above program to print the greatest factor of a number beside itself using a while loop.
// Hint => 
// Get an integer input and assign it to the number variable. As well as define a greatestFactor variable and assign it to 1
// Create a variable counter and assign counter = number - 1; Use the while loop till the counter is equal to 1.
// Inside the loop, check if the number is perfectly divisible by the counter then assign the counter to greatestFactor variable and break the loop.
// Display the greatestFactor variable outside the loop
